# Stock Price Prediction README

## Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing historical stock price data and building predictive models using decision trees, linear regression, and random forest regressor algorithms. The goal is to demonstrate various techniques for predicting stock prices based on historical data.

## Files
- MSFT.csv: CSV file containing historical stock price data for Microsoft.
- stock_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.
- README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
- Requirements of libraries.

## Usage
- Clone this repository.
- Ensure you have the required dataset MSFT.csv in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
- Open stock_price_prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, visualize it, and build     predictive models.
- Explore the results and experiment with different algorithms and parameters as needed.

## About the Project
This project demonstrates how to:

- Load and preprocess historical stock price data.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using seaborn and matplotlib.
- Build predictive models using decision trees, linear regression, and random forest regressor algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

## Note
This project focuses on predicting stock prices for Microsoft (MSFT) using historical data. You can modify the code to work with other stock datasets by replacing MSFT.csv with the desired CSV file.

# Code Title: Mad Libs Generator

## Overview:
    This code is a Mad Libs generator, a game where players fill in the blanks of a story with their own words. Mad Libs typically consist of a pre-written story with placeholders for different types of words (e.g., nouns, adjectives, verbs), and players provide words to fill in these blanks, resulting in a humorous or nonsensical story when read aloud.

## Features:
    Input: The code prompts the user to choose a Mad Libs template by entering a number between 1 and 3.

    Template Selection: Based on the user's input, the code selects one of three predefined Mad Libs templates.

    User Input: For each selected template, the code prompts the user to enter specific types of words (e.g., nouns, adjectives, verbs) required to complete the story.

    Story Generation: Using the user-provided words, the code fills in the blanks in the selected Mad Libs template, creating a unique and often humorous story.

    Output: The completed Mad Libs story is displayed to the user.

## Usage:
    Run the code.

    Choose a template by entering a number between 1 and 3 when prompted.

    Follow the prompts to enter words corresponding to different parts of speech (e.g., nouns, adjectives, verbs) required to complete the selected Mad Libs template.

    Once all words are provided, the code generates and displays the completed Mad Libs story.
